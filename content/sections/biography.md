bio: >-
  Hi, I'm Barry - 3x exited Silicon Valley entrepreneur turned conscious
  capitalist. <br /><br />As CEO of SUPERNOVA, I lead a conscious collective of
  150+ exited founders who invest, advise and mentor world-changing companies to
  achieve their missions, faster.<br /><br />My 25+ year career includes
  consulting for 20% of the Fortune 500, building a $315MM+ business at Acxiom
  as a global corporate innovation leader, and scaling my first startup to a
  $1.6B exit with Oracle. I co-founded 1heart, a human accelerator to elevate
  leaders' lives by expanding consciousness and solving planetary problems.<br
  /><br /> I'm here to serve and spark the mindset shift our future demands. At
  conferences, corporate events, and leadership retreats, my talks empower
  audiences to rise to the moment—unlocking access to our higher selves and
  superpowers. It's our time to shine by solving the pressing challenges of our
  time and play a greater game.<br /><br />Let’s connect and co-create an
  unforgettable experience together.
